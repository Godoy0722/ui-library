# FieldContrastColorPicker

This component provides a dual color picker interface for selecting a color pair with optimal contrast. It's specifically designed for theme configuration where text readability is important.

## Usage

Use this component when you need users to select two colors that work well together for accessibility purposes, such as text color against a background. The component:

- Allows selection of two colors (typically primary/background and secondary/text colors)
- Displays the calculated contrast ratio between the selected colors
- Shows visual indicators for WCAG accessibility compliance levels

## Features

- Two color pickers with hex color selection
- Live preview of text appearance with the selected colors
- Real-time contrast ratio calculation
- Visual indicators for WCAG accessibility compliance levels:
  - AA Large Text (3:1)
  - AA Normal Text (4.5:1)
  - AAA Normal Text (7:1)
  - Enhanced (14:1)
  - Maximum (21:1)

## Technical Details

### Data Structure

The component stores both colors in a JSON string format:

```json
{
	"color1": "#1E6292",
	"color2": "#FFFFFF"
}
```

### WCAG Compliance

The component uses the WCAG formula to calculate luminance and contrast between colors:

- Relative luminance is calculated using the formula specified in WCAG 2.0
- Contrast ratio is calculated as (L1 + 0.05) / (L2 + 0.05), where L1 is the lighter color's luminance and L2 is the darker color's luminance

### Events

- `change`: Emitted when either color changes, with the stringified JSON value
- `update:contrastColor`: Emitted when the second color is updated
